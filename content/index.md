Hypi is a platform for developing lightening fast, scalable data driven applications.

## Introduction
Most modern software can largely be composed by using the right set of building blocks.
Hypi supports this paradigm by taking the next step beyond micro services whilst retaining all of its benefits.

## Getting started

The documentation is arranged so that you can find information by [product](/products), [tutorials](/tutorials) or [reference](/reference) material.

You can start with the [Introduction](/introduction) and work your way through from start to end.

If you're new to Hypi, we recommend you start with the tutorials. They provide a guided approach that will get you up and running quickly.

Reference documentation is more detailed and includes information that the tutorials sometimes gloss over.
