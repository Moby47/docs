Hypi is centered around Apps. An App acts as a container or namespace for a group of related features including but not limited to the Data Models, Scripts, Blocks, Auth Policies and more. 

Hypi is an App oriented Platform, so much so almost every operation possible on the platform is done through an existing app, even creating an app uses the Hypi store app to create other apps.
