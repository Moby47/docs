Many applications can benefit from realtime updates. 
In Hypi every GraphQL mutation can be automatically published to interested parties.

The subscription API is available at `wss://api.hypi.app/ws`.

Note: Only secure websockets is supported. To learn more about the API, see the [realtime docs](/reference/05-realtime)
