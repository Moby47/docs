### Overview
It's easy to adopt Hypi incrementally; you can set it up alongside an existing solution (such as a REST API) and migrate functionality at your convenience. Or, instantly adopt Hypi and quickly build scalable cloud applications and web services. Starting from scratch is easy, and we'll show you how.


### Starting from scratch
 <a href="/getting-started/scratch">Starting from scratch</a> —
adding Hypi to your front-end clients, you need to:
 <div class="my-3" id="table-of-contents">
<ol>
<li><a href="/getting-started/scratch#creatinganaccount">Create a Hypi account</a></li>
<li><a href="/getting-started/scratch#creatinganapp">Create an app from your dashboard</a></li>
<li><a href="/getting-started/scratch#creatingarelease">Create a release within your app</a></li>
<li><a href="/getting-started/scratch#modellingyourschema">Model your schema for your release within your app</a></li>
<li><a href="/getting-started/scratch#creatinganinstanceapi">Create an instance from the release</a></li>
<li><a href="/getting-started/scratch#queryingyourinstanceapi">Make queries to your instance</a></li>
</ol>
</div>
You can follow the <a href="/getting-started/scratch">start from the scratch guide</a>, which will walk you through each of the above steps.

### Using an existing framework

[Front-end Agnostic](/getting-started/angular) —
Flexibility is important, which is why Hypi is front-end agnostic; meaning you can use Hypi with your favourite front-end framework. Checkout the [Angular guide](/getting-started/angular) or the [React Native tutorial](https://hypi.io/2020/10/12/how-to-build-react-native-app-and-integrate-it-with-hypi-io/), we will show you how to get set up.

### Making a request

[Making requests](getting-started/angular) —
No API is truly complete until you can successfully make requests and carry out your desired transactions. After creating an API, you can use the built-in GraphQL editor to test and run operations against the API. For example,

`create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete` (CRUD) and even add `Trash` which lets you remove data without deleting it. You can read more about these  [operation here](/tutorials/crud). That's just the basic, imagine using:

<ul>
<li><a href="/references/analytics">Analytics</a></li>
<li><a href="/references/user-defined-functions">Serverless Functions and User-defined functions</a></li>
<li><a href="/references/workflow">Workflows</a></li>
<li><a href="/references/api-gateway">API Gateway for interoperability</a></li>
<li><a href="/references/workflow">webhooks</a></li>
</ul>

The above is tip of the iceberg. See how to integrate Hypi with a [native react app](https://hypi.io/2020/10/12/how-to-build-react-native-app-and-integrate-it-with-hypi-io/). Hypi is easy to set up and easy to use. [Here](/getting-started/angular) you will learn how to set up an Angular project and make a request to your APIs and more.
