<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hypi's blog is focused on producing high quality relevant content. In general we're interested in technology related content. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hypi content should generally fall under one of two types.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Tutorial</strong> - these articles provide a step by step guide to achieving some task. The steps should be clear and concise and the article should be self-contained (Readers shouldn't need to go researching to complete the tutorial. This is different to prerequisites which can include links to other tutorials).</li><li><strong>Reviews</strong> - these articles are intended to be informational. They can review technologies, new techniques, libraries, frameworks or languages. They should be well balanced (if reviewing a new technology, don't just talk about benefits, talk about draw backs and/or alternatives too). Be informative and provide factual information that readers can use to draw their own conclusions. If making recommendations, ensure they're justified in the review. <br><br>You can still write with excitement for your favourite topic, just be sure to explain why it is exciting for you and why others may find it exciting too.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use categories and tags. <strong>You MUST set either the review or tutorial categories and have AT LEAST one tag for your post.</strong> Posts with images/diagrams are preferred. Use <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a> to get free stock images that can be used in your posts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an author for Hypi, you should bare these rule of thumb guidelines in mind whenever you write content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Recommended topics</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a platform Hypi encourages diversity in technologies. Embrace the right tool for the job, still we have our preferences on the content we'd like published in our blog. The list is non-exhaustive but clearly highlights enough for most to have content on to write several books.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One can choose to write articles (both tutorials and reviews) on any of these topics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Style</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hypi articles style are inspired by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines">DigitalOcean's</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Articles should be</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Comprehensive and written for all experience levels</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Articles should written to be as clear and detailed as possible without making assumptions about the reader’s background knowledge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Provide any explanation and background information needed by the reader.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Technically detailed and correct</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your article includes commands, ensure they're exactly what the reader needs to type (likely copy and paste).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Practical, useful, and self-contained</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An article should contain all information a reader needs. Do not send readers offsite for information that could easily be included, link to other Hypi articles where possible but generally cover everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Friendly but formal</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our tutorials aim for a friendly but formal tone. This means that articles do not include jargon, memes, or excessive jokes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tutorials should have one goal in mind. By reading the tutorial a reader should be able to achieve that goal following the steps it outlines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A structure recommended for tutorials is as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tutorials have a consistent structure comprised of the following sections:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Title</li><li>Introduction</li><li>Goals (Optional)</li><li>Prerequisites</li><li>Step 1 — Doing the First Thing</li><li>Step 2 — Doing the Next Thing</li><li>…</li><li>Step n — Doing the Last Thing</li><li>Conclusion</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are the same as the DigitalOcean structure. If in doubt about what should be in each step, consult <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines#structure">this link</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Reviews</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reviews can have a lighter tone than tutorials but are still required to have useful, factual information. A review should be trying to answer these question:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Introduction</li><li><strong>What is it?</strong> - What is the subject of this post and why should readers care?</li><li><strong>Who is it for? </strong>- Who is the subject of the post intended to be for. If it's a technology, is it for consumers, developers etc...be as specific as possible</li><li><strong>Who can access it and when?</strong> - A product may be in private beta/invite only or only on certain plans</li><li><strong>Why would the reader use it? </strong></li><li><strong>When would the reader use it?</strong></li><li><strong>What benefits does the subject of the post have for the reader/user</strong>? </li><li><strong>What are the drawbacks of the subject of the post?</strong></li><li><strong>Are there alternatives?</strong></li><li><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></li><li>Do you have any <strong>recommendations</strong> for the reader? <strong>Why</strong>...?</li><li>Summary - wrap up every post with a brief summary and what may be next (if there are expected follow ups)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not all of these questions will apply to every review but they should be considered. Once a review is submitted for review these are the questions that the reviewer will be checking to see if the post answers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
