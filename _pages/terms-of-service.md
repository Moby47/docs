            <strong> Eligibility</strong>
          </li>
        </ol> The Service is available only for individuals aged 18 years or older. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change the eligibility criteria for using the Service at any time. The right to access the Service is revoked where these Terms of Service or use of the Service is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale, or provision of the Service conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation. If you are entering into these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its affiliates, and all users who access the Service through your account to these Terms of Service, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity, its affiliates, and users associated with it. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these Terms of Service, you must not accept these Terms of Service and you may not use the Service. You further agree that you assume all responsibility and liability in connection with your use of the Service on behalf of such a company or other legal entity, and you shall be solely responsible for all disputes, if any, that arise due to your use of the Service on behalf of such a company or other legal entity.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Registering for an account.</strong>To use the Service, you will need to register and create an account (including your full name, password, and email address). If you upgrade your account, you will need to provide payment information as well. Hypi accounts will give you access to the Service and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time at our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of users. If you open a Hypi account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By connecting to Hypi with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your login credentials for that service. For more information on the types of information we collect from these third-party services, please read our <u>Global Privacy Policy</u>. We reserve the right to reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim or trademark on those usernames.

It is your sole responsibility to: (i) control the dissemination and use of your account and password, and (ii) promptly inform us of any need to deactivate an account or password. We are not liable for any harm related to the theft of passwords, or your disclosure of passwords.

You alone are responsible for any of your User Content that may be lost or unrecoverable through your use of the Service. You are encouraged to archive your User Content regularly and frequently. Additionally, you may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments, ideas, or feedback about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products (“Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited, and without restriction and will not place Hypi under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Feedback without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Hypi does not waive any rights to use similar or related Feedback previously known to Hypi, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you. Additionally, you acknowledge that all email and other correspondence that you submit to us shall become our sole and exclusive property. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals, and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory, or other jurisdiction. You own all of the User Content you post or publish (“post”) on the Service. You grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use, modify, reproduce, display, and distribute your User Content on the Service for the purposes of operating and providing the Service to you and other users (“User Content License”). You understand and agree that the Service is a public platform and other users may search for, see, use, and/or re-post any User Content that you make publicly available through the Service.

            <strong> Rules</strong>
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <strong>Your obligations to end users</strong> <ol>
          <li>
            <strong> Roles. </strong>Hypi is a “service provider” to you, and you are a “customer” of our Services irrespective of whether you pay fees to obtain the Services. Any natural persons accessing or using your Hypi account, the websites, pages, features, or content created by you on our Services are deemed your “end users.” Hypi does not have a direct relationship with any of your end users, therefore Hypi is not responsible for how you handle end user information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Applicable laws.</strong>You may have additional obligations under local law other than those described in this Terms of Service, particularly if you or your end users are located outside of the United Kingdom. Such obligations may be more restrictive than this Terms of Service. Use of the Services does not ensure compliance with such laws, nor is Hypi responsible for your compliance with such laws. To the extent Hypi has any obligations to assist you with handling end user information, such obligations are enumerated within a <u>Data Processing Agreement</u> executed between Hypi and you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Security safeguards. </strong>You will use all reasonable efforts to protect information collected from end users via your use of the Services, including any personal information obtained from unauthorized access or use. In the event you discover that the end user information collected by you has been breached, compromised, or inadvertently exposed to non-authorized third parties, you shall notify Hypi promptly of such a breach or exposure including the root cause, remediation steps, and compensating controls to ensure such a breach does not occur in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Security notification.</strong>You are responsible for providing notification to your end users, third parties, or authorities under the applicable breach notification statutes and any other applicable data protection laws. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any personal injury or property damage arising from or relating to your use of any Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Privacy.</strong>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for providing any required notices and obtaining all required consents from end users in connection with any use of the Services. Your notice and consent must be compliant with all applicable data protection and security laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, before collecting or using any end user information, you must provide adequate notice of the end user information you collect, how it will be used and/or shared, and obtain any necessary consents required under the applicable data protection laws and regulations. You agree to comply with all data protection laws and regulations (including those applying to personal information) in connection with your access and use of the Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Notice. </strong>You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your use of the Services that: (i) complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, (ii) is conspicuously displayed to all end users, and (iii) clearly and accurately describes to end users what information you collect (such as login information, contact form data, cookies, etc.) and how you use and share such information (including for marketing and advertising) with Hypi and other third parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Privacy rights. </strong>You will respond to any end users wishing to exercise their privacy rights, under the applicable law, as it relates to any information collected via your use of the Services. For example, if end users located in certain jurisdictions may exercise a “right to be forgotten” (or “erasure”) to the information you have collected about them, you shall comply with their request as required by applicable law. For clarity, you are directly responsible (or, the “data controller”) for the information processed by your use of the Services, including any information processed via third-party applications available on the Services. Hypi is not a data controller to such information and is not responsible for responding to end users on your behalf. To the extent Hypi receives a request from an end user or authority about your use of the Services, Hypi will notify you as permitted by law.
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <strong>User content</strong> <ol>
          <li>
            You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights, publicity rights, or rights of privacy. If you think any User Content infringes your rights, or if you want to challenge User Content that has been taken down from the site, please refer to Hypi’s Copyright Policy in Section 13 below. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates the Agreement.

            <strong> Amendments, notification procedures, and changes to the Agreement</strong>
          </li>
        </ol> We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, update, or change the Terms of Service (“Updated Terms”) from time to time, so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the “last modified” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service. Hypi is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. Hypi may provide such notifications, whether the notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Hypi in our sole discretion. Hypi reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification by contacting us at <u>support.hypi.io</u>. You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Service and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. The Terms of Service will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.

            <strong> Dispute resolution</strong>
          </li>
        </ol> INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Hypi agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Hypi. Hypi’s address for such notices is Hypi Ltd., Kemp House, 152 City Road, London, United Kingdom, EC1V 2NX. BINDING ARBITRATION. If you and Hypi are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Service (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Hypi will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Hypi may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a UK court with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You and Hypi agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Hypi and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Hypi ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Hypi otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” Section will be deemed null and void. LOCATION OF ARBITRATION. Arbitration will take place in London, UK. You and Hypi agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the UK courts located in London, United Kingdom have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Hypi agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

You agree that Hypi’s remedy at law for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and that Hypi shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relief, or both, in addition to any damages that Hypi may be legally entitled to recover, together with reasonable expenses of any form of dispute resolution, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees. No right or remedy of Hypi shall be exclusive of any other, whether at law or in equity, including without limitation damages injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, and expenses. No instance of waiver by Hypi of its rights or remedies under these terms and conditions shall imply any obligation to grant any similar, future, or other waiver.
