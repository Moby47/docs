        <em>Effective from: </em><em>1<sup>st</sup> Sept, 2018</em> This Cookie Policy (“Policy”) explains how Hypi Ltd. ("Hypi", "we", "us" and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies (like web beacons) when you visit any of our websites that link to this Cookie Policy (such as www.Hypi.io) ("Websites"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect Personal Information or information that becomes Personal Information if we combine it with other information. In such cases, the Hypi <u>Global Privacy Policy</u> will also apply, as will the <u>EU & Swiss Privacy Policy</u>, if applicable. Capitalised terms that are not defined in this Policy have the meaning given them in our <u>Hypi Global Privacy Policy</u> or our <u>Terms of Service</u>. What cookies are A cookie is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computer’s hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a user’s computer and web browser and tailor web pages and/or login information to a user’s preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information needed to use the capabilities on the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to visitors to the Sites and users of the Service. By gathering and remembering information about website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Cookies do not give us access to your computer.‍ The types of cookies Hypi uses There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. We use both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when the web browser is closed or computer is turned off. We also utilize persistent cookies to make it easier to log into and use the Service. Persistent cookies remain on computers after the web browser is closed or the computer is turned off.   Cookies on customer sites The cookies described in this Policy only apply to Hypi’s own marketing and products websites or apps that are created with Hypi or published via Hypi Hosting may also need Hypi’s cookies to deliver their service. Customers may make changes to their websites or apps at their own discretion that may cause cookies to be added (for example, enabling Google Analytics, using a Facebook Like button, or adding custom code), but these changes are optional and not made by Hypi. Third-party cookies Cookies set by us are called "first-party cookies," while cookies set by others are called "third-party cookies." A third-party cookie can recognize your device both when it visits our Services and when it visits certain other websites or mobile apps. Hypi does not control how third-party cookies are used, so you should check the website of a third-party cookie provider for more information about how they are used. Both first-party and third-party cookies can serve many functions, including analytics, marketing, and advertising. For more information about how you can control advertising or analytics cookies, please see the relevant section below. We do not track or respond to browser “Do Not Track” requests. Cookies and your Personal Information Some cookies are associated with your account and Personal Information, while others are not. We generally treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑Personal information. However, to the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered Personal Information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as Personal Information. If we combine non-Personal Information with Personal Information, then the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined. Why Hypi uses cookies and similar tracking technologies Hypi uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to enable functionality on its Services, and to assist with marketing its products and services to interested individuals.

Below  is an explanation of how we generally use cookies.   Authentication These cookies help us show you the right information by personalising the Services to your account.

Preferences and functionality These cookies allow our Services to recognise you and your preferences. For example, they can auto-fill a form for you, provide you with customised content, remember your application settings, and more. Advertising These cookies allow us to show you advertising about Hypi on and off the Services. They tell us whether you took an action after seeing one of our ads, such as signing up for a webinar or other event by Hypi. They also let our advertising partners know how well our ads are doing by measuring the ad’s success and the types of interactions people have with our ads. Research, performance, and analytics These cookies help us understand how well our Services are doing by measuring your interactions with our Services.

Hypi's use of log files Hypi gathers certain information automatically and stores it in logs. This information includes an anonymised internet protocol address as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, search terms, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyse trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service. Hypi's use of clear GIFs/web beacons When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. The shelf lives of cookies The length of time we keep your cookie information depends on the type of cookie. A session cookie will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. However, persistent cookies and other types of tracking information may be stored by your device until they expire or are deleted (i.e., after you’ve finished browsing). Changes to Hypi's Cookie Policy We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update this Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will endeavour to notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Sites prior to the change becoming effective, but will not be liable for any failure to do so. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance to be bound by such changes to this Policy. Your only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Service.
