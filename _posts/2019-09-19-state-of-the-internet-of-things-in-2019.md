<p>Nowadays, The Internet of things is
becoming a hot topic of conversation. This concept has the power to strongly impact
how we live and work. IoT is a huge network of connected things. It describes
a world where nearly anything can be connected and communicate in an
intelligent manner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <strong>1999</strong>, the term
"Internet of Things" was used by <em>Kevin
Ashton</em> during his work at Procter&amp;Gamble which became widely accepted.
Between <strong>2008 and 2009</strong>, the Internet
of Things was <em>born</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The term Internet of things refers to
the <strong><em>network
of physical devices</em></strong> connected to the
Internet and/or to each other, containing electronics and sensors embedded
within their architecture for collecting
and transmitting data via the Internet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the internet of things, the physical world is becoming a significant information system. The <em>goal</em> of the Internet of things is to extend to internet connectivity from standard devices like laptops, smartphones, and IPads to comparatively simpler devices like a lamp or a toaster. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are four basic components of IoT systems which are involved in the working of IoT. These components are given below:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Sensors or Devices:&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sensors/devices are a key component that assists you in
collecting data from the external environment. The data may have many levels of
complexities. A device may have different
types of sensors which performs multiple tasks&nbsp;<strong>other
than</strong> sensing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, a smartphone has multiple sensors like the camera
but the smartphone is not able to sense these things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Connectivity:&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the collected data from the sensors/devices are sent
to a cloud infrastructure. It is necessary to connect sensors or devices to the
cloud through different communication mediums. These communication mediums could
be Bluetooth, WI-FI, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Data Processing:&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the data is collected and send to the cloud, the
software performs processing on the collected data. The data processing can be
simple like checking the temperature or can be very complex like identifying
objects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>User Interface:</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The data is now processed into a piece of useful
information. This information needs to be available to the end-user. This can
be done by triggering alarms on the userâ€™s phone or sending him notifications through
emails or/and text messages. The user may want an interface to examine their
IOT system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, if the user has a camera installed in his
office and he wants to access its video recording. This can be achieved with
the help of a web server.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Applications of IoT</strong></p>
