<p><strong>Smart Farming</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Precision Agriculture or Smart farming is one of the sectors
with the highest development opportunities and with the lowest penetration, to
date, of digitized solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a sector that needs digital solutions for
environmental and territorial sensors, applications for the weather, automation
of equipment for the increasingly precise management of water, fertilizers,
fertilizers, agrochemicals. These are the areas where IoT can revolutionize
farming. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the agricultural sector, now robots and AI next
generation of agriculture "that utilizes IoT" has appeared, it has
attracted attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>what is precision
agriculture?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Precision agriculture consists of the process of managing
the different crops by observing, measuring and generating actions based on the
results obtained from the analysis of the different elements that affect crop
productivity. For this, sensors are used that collect information that is then
used to make decisions with greater precision, and also to optimize crop
yields.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Stages in
precision agriculture</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The arrival of low-cost solutions that incorporate multiple sensors and that use Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) networks to transmit small data packets greatly enhance the possibilities of achieving extraordinary results through precision agriculture models based on IoT. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crop management based on smart or precision agriculture
encompasses monitoring activities, support tools for decision-making and the
performance of actions that automatically control one or more systems
(irrigation, frost protection, fertilization, etc.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>01 ACQUIRE THE
DATA</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1318,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://hypi.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/paprika-2345580_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1318"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using temperature sensors, humidity, soil conditions, climatic conditions among many others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>02 ANALYSIS OF
DATA</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Generation of KPIs, graphs, reports, alerts that allow
obtaining visibility on the conditions and variables that are intended to be
evaluated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>03 DECISION MAKING</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The expert will have information to take preventive or
corrective decisions according to the particular conditions and objectives of
the crop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>04 RESULTS
MONITORING</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The continuous information allows us to analyze results,
learn from the executed actions and plan to improve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The solution based on a series of sensors, devices and a
computer application allows to obtain detailed information of the crop, the
soil and of the more granular climatic variations than the techniques of
traditional agriculture directly impacting on the quality of the products, in
the processes that are made and in the raw materials or inputs used in the
activity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Purpose of smart
agriculture</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Efforts using advanced technology called “Smart” are being
promoted in various fields, and there are many products and solutions.
Smartphones, smartwatches, smart speakers, smart homes, and even smart
communities using these devices are born.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among them, smart agriculture has been regarded as an
industry that is difficult to introduce, especially in fields that have often
been thought to have little connection with technologies such as IT and ICT. It
has accelerated all at once in the last few years, and its introduction is
growing rapidly, regardless of size.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following can be considered as the purpose of
introducing smart agriculture:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1. Labor-saving
and labor reduction of farm work</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first is labor-saving and light labor in farming. The
agricultural sector in every country is experiencing a serious labor shortage
due to the aging of individual farmers. It is required to support such
hardships in agriculture using IoT.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2. The succession
of agricultural technology</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second is the succession of cultivation skills to new
workers. There is a shortage of human resources to succeed in inheritance and
agriculture so that the agricultural technology cultivated in the inheritance
of family members can be inherited continuously by smart agriculture systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3. Increase food
self-sufficiency</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third purpose is smart agriculture as a measure against
food self-sufficiency in the world. Many developing even developed countries’
imports exceed domestic production, making it difficult to say that the
appropriate balance is maintained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to increase the yield and raise the self-sufficiency ratio in the shortage of human resources as mentioned above, automation with sensors and robots is indispensable for reliably growing agricultural products with a small number of personnel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://hypi.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/grapes-690230_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1319"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4. Cost reduction
and quality Improvement</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reduction of costs, the improvements in the process and
in the care of the crops, the optimization in the use of material and human
resources, the increase of the yield per hectare cultivated, the greater
quality of final product and the decrease of discard, the compliance with
national and international requirements of production and product
characteristics, etc. These are some of the concrete benefits of opting for a
Simple IoT Smart Agriculture solution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Example of Cost
Reduction:</strong>
On-line monitoring of soil temperature and humidity will collaborate in
detecting if the environment is conducive to the proliferation of fungi and
pests in crops, this allows them to apply fertilizers and fungicides
efficiently and accurately obtaining a cost reduction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Example of Product
Quality Increase:</strong>
Optimization of production and quality improvement will be possible, among
other things, by making online measurements of the size of the stem and of the
fruit or crop in question, the level of water required for irrigation, the
value of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (RFA / PAR) to measure the conditions
of photosynthesis, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>5. Realtime data
collection </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of this also has real-time and historical weather
information through different sensors and devices that allow monitoring of
atmospheric pressure, air temperature and humidity, wind speed and direction,
amount of rainfall, dew point, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the information collected is stored to be able to make
statistical reports, traceability, extract data to carry out corrective or
preventive actions, issue alerts, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The solution not only allows us to expose the information in
a complete way and of easy visualization, additionally, at the request of the
client it can generate notices or alerts in mobile devices of data processing
or cell phones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Practical
applications of the Internet of Things in the agricultural sector</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The agricultural sector has also launched into the
hyperconnected world. Thanks to Smart Agriculture we can obtain detailed
information on the crop, soil and climatic variations in real-time from any
tablet or smartphone. New IoT technologies have broken into strong sectors such
as agriculture or livestock with the aim of improving the quality of life and
reducing heavy work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here we want to analyze some of the practical applications
of the Internet of Things in this sector:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The smart tractors</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1318,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://hypi.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/paprika-2345580_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1318"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These tractors are to replace the driver's cab for a complete standalone system based on cameras, radar, GPS and sensors that detect obstacles and make the vehicle change direction to avoid impacts. The farmer programs it with an application and can make it work simultaneously with other tractors. Thanks to the introduction of maps in the system, with the limits of the field and, in addition, it includes software of route planning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Drones</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drones are unmanned aircraft that will increasingly fly over
agricultural land. The market of the drone is moving at a rapid pace.&nbsp; Many farmers already use them to know the
state of the crops accurately in real-time and thus carry out a precision
pesticide spraying. In Poland, they have even started to work with the drone
called 'bee drones' in order to favor world pollination due to the reduction of
bees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Online monitoring
through sensors</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Online monitoring through sensors allows farmers to know
from their smartphone or tablet the temperature, humidity and stem size of the
fruit or crop. Depending on the state of the crops, each person can adapt to
each farm the treatment of fertilizers and fungicides effectively and
accurately. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Smart Devices for
Livestock</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connected livestock is another of the advances that are
already being made. Tools and sensors that measure the movement of cattle,
control their nutrition and even their reproductive capacity. In addition,
farmers can always know the location of animals to facilitate their counting
and reduce theft.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Smart Pest Control</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smart pest controls through remote sensors are installed in
crops and warn farmers about the most suitable conditions for pest
proliferation. Even the actions necessary to combat them can be performed
manually or automatically thanks to the use of new technologies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Artificial
intelligence (AI) in Agriculture</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AI can also be used to systematize and provide technologies
and know-how for new farmers. By doing this, even people who have no experience
or knowledge of agriculture can engage in agriculture and hope to help solve
the shortage of human resources. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some programs have already been developed and put into
practical use, such as programs that analyze the degree of growth based on the
shape and color of crops to predict and judge harvest time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, it is possible to detect information on crop
pests at an early stage by using image analysis using AI and to provide countermeasures.
In both cases, demonstration experiments have already begun, and there are
cases where these have been partially commercialized.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The growth situation from the field image of the drone is
growing especially recently in the field of agriculture using AI. Judgment or
detection of pests and dealing with them. The Japanese developed “Pinpoint
Pesticide Spraying Technology” that sprays pesticides only on the points where
the detected pests are present, reducing the labor of spraying the pesticides,
reducing the cost of the sprayed pesticides, and above all, affecting the
natural environment and crops. Keeping it the minimum necessity. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, this technology can be utilized not only for
large-scale farmers but also for small and medium-sized farmers who have only
small fields and may become a technology that supports successor farmers and
new farmers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smart Agriculture is able to cover and provide solutions to
the entire production cycle and also to the harvest and storage stages of the final
product.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Smart agriculture
case study</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we have spoken so far, it is by no means a dream story in pursuit of ideals. Although it takes time to spread to ordinary farmers, there are already examples of smart agriculture introduced all over the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Netherlands, which is said to be a developed country of
smart agriculture, is a pioneer that is always mentioned when talking about
smart agriculture. In Dutch farms, infrastructure using smartphones and tablets
has been developed so that the state of crop growth can be monitored 24 hours a
day. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, agriculture using the latest technology, such
as sensing technology using various sensors and network technology using IoT,
and even renewable energy is being deployed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Disadvantages of smart
agriculture, future challenges</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smart agriculture seems to be a good thing in this way, but
naturally, there are some disadvantages if you want to introduce smart
agriculture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The initial cost
is expensive</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, the initial cost of an introduction is higher
than that of ordinary agricultural machines. How to keep development costs low
depends on the skill of the manufacturer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, even if it can be introduced, ICT and robots
that have just begun to be used in the agricultural field also have an aspect
that it is difficult to make a cost-effective outlook. Many farmers say they
have given up on the way because they were unable to use it after all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Variation in the
data format of individual devices</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1316,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://hypi.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Diversité_IOT.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1316"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, these ICT devices and robots are products that are unique to each manufacturer, so the problem is the standardization of software and data formats. These things need to be taken into consideration from the long-term perspective to data storage, management, and migration. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is because interoperability is not possible if it is
divided into its own systems and standards. However, the development of these
OSs and middleware often falls under the dilemma that standardization is not
progressing easily because organizations such as companies are often
independently developing in order to gain market share.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shortage and
development of smart farmers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The viewpoint of human resource development for smartness is
also needed. There are few people who can quickly use such smart devices for
aging farmers. Support systems for mastering smart devices and the development
of IT-savvy personnel are urgently needed in the agricultural field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>New work burden on
farmers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The introduction of such smart agriculture places a
financial, time and technical burden on the farmers. It will be more difficult
to learn than the introduction of agricultural machines as before, and it will
be very difficult for those who are not used to data input and data analysis
using personal computers, smartphones, and tablets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Taste of
vegetables grown in smart agriculture</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don't forget the taste of crops. No matter how smart
agriculture increases efficiency and yields, consumers will not choose unless
it is delicious food. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plant factory as efforts to stable constant yield can be
obtained. On the other hand, the plant factory of vegetables that have
undergone artificial light, such as LED cannot be compared with the food
growing up in response to full sunlight. There must be a taste difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no doubt that smart agriculture will reduce the
burden of our agricultural work. However, it is a “means” for making delicious
vegetables, not a “purpose”. I want to keep in mind that smart agriculture is
the way to grow nutritious and delicious vegetables.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A wave of change is about to come to the world of
agriculture that has long been screamed to eliminate human resource shortages
and improve productivity. IT technology is the driving force. “Smart farming”,
which uses IoT (Internet of Things) and the cloud to optimize the whole farm
management from production management to quality control, distribution, and
sales, is drawing attention.</p>
