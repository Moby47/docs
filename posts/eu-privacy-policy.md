*Effective date: **1<sup>st</sup> Sept, 2018* Welcome to the Hypi Ltd., (hereinafter, “Hypi,” “Company,” “us,” “our,” or “we”) EU & Swiss Privacy Policy (the “Policy”). This Policy governs our information-handling practices as applicable to residents in the European Union (“EU”), European Economic Area (“EEA”), and Switzerland (collectively, the “Data Subjects”) that are visiting our website, www.Hypi.io, and the other websites under the Hypi brand (collectively, the “Sites”), or are customers who use our SaaS product, web design software, apps, tools, and related services (together with the Sites, the “Service” or “Platform”). This Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Data Subjects’ information as part of the Service in accordance with data-protection laws in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland (collectively the “Data Protection Laws”). Any discussion of your use of the Service in this Policy is meant to include your visits and other interactions with the Sites and Services, whether or not you are a user of Hypi’s SaaS product.

If you do not agree with or you are not comfortable with any aspect of this Policy, our Global Policy or the Terms of Service, you should immediately discontinue access or use of our Services.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

We will inform you if the restriction is lifted.

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->

*   Notification of erasure, rectification, and restriction. We will communicate any rectification or erasure of your Personal Information or restriction of processing to each recipient to whom your Personal Information has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will inform you about those recipients if you request this information. If we have made your Personal Information public and we are required to erase the Personal Information, we will, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other parties that are processing your Personal Information that you have requested the erasure of any links to, or copy or replication of your Personal Information.
