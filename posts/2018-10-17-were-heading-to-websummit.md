After a stunning start to autumn, we're heading to [the largest tech conference in Europe][1]! As part of the Alpha program, we are planning on showing the latest Hypi has to offer.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This year at WebSummit, our goal is similar to what it was at Collision - to get tech and developer communities familiar with Hypi. We plan to focus on making our platform ready for everyone! Features you can expect to see include:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

*   Generated GraphQL CRUD APIs for Developers
*   The ability to build front-end applications using any language or framework
*   Simple scripting API to add custom GraphQL functions without need to go fully serverless when you don’t need to
*   Powerful, role-based access control for the ability to model anything from small apps to enterprise level apps

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Come see how we can take accelerate development time from 6 months to 6 weeks via the platform. Our “pay as you go” option allows you to take advantage of serverless deployments without the overhead of the API platform. With an integrated payment platform we also make it easy to accept payments within your application with common payment processing providers like Stripe and PayPal.

Hypi is built to grow with you with tunable replication for scale and resilience right out of the box. With applications already built in like Hypi Cabinet (cloud storage), document and spreadsheet cloud applications, presentation anywhere capabilities, and more office related cloud software coming in late 2018 and early 2019 - Hypi is the answer to all your organisation’s needs.

We’re looking forward to seeing everyone in Lisbon! Stop by and see us in our booth.
