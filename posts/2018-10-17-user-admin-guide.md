# Accounts {#accounts}

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Although some actions are possible without signing in or having an account, to really reap the benefits of the Hypi platform, one must be authenticated.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Most of this documentation assumes as much. Only where explicitly noted can actions be performed without first being authenticated.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There are two main types of entities recognised on the platform. First, **Organisations** and second **Users**.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## Organisations {#organisations}

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

An organisation represents a grouping. Many actions on the platform depend on the organisations a user belongs to. It does not necessarily have to represent a company but generally does.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When apps are added from the app store they are added to an organisation, not to the user who added it. Of course, a user with the permission to do so can decide to restrict visibility of an app to certain users only or to give different permissions to different users which results in them being able to perform different actions and see different things in the same app.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## Users {#users}

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A user represents a single account which can be used to authenticate and access apps and data within one or more organisations to which they have access. Users are often humans but external services can also have user accounts that are given access to an organisation allowing it to act on behalf of the organisation's users e.g. a service which automatically gathers data and generates reports.

### Subject {#subject}

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Subject is the general term used to refer to any user account whether it belongs to a human, an app or some other entity.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

## Policies, Roles and Permissions {#roles-and-permissions}

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This combination gives a powerful set of options enabling a great level of control over what actions a subject can perform.
